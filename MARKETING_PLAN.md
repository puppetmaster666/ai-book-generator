# DraftMyBook Marketing Plan

**Budget:** $50
**Goal:** Rapid user acquisition through organic content + targeted micro-spend

---

## Platform Strategy

### 1. TikTok (PRIMARY - Highest ROI potential)

**Why:** Organic reach is unmatched. One viral video = thousands of users.

**Content Ideas:**
- "I made an AI write a children's book in 10 minutes" (screen recording, fast-paced)
- "POV: You finally write that book you've been thinking about"
- "Watch AI generate a complete novel chapter by chapter"
- Before/after: blank screen → finished book with cover
- "Things that feel illegal but aren't: AI writing your book"
- Reaction to the generated book/illustrations
- "Testing if AI can write better than me"

**Posting Schedule:** 1-2 videos/day for first 2 weeks

**Hashtags:** #aitools #booktok #writertok #selfpublishing #amazonkdp #authortok #aigenerated #sidehustle

**Hook Formula:** First 1 second must grab attention. Start with the result, then show the process.

---

### 2. Instagram Reels

**Why:** Repurpose TikTok content, different audience (older, more buyers)

**Content:**
- Same TikToks, reposted as Reels
- Carousel posts: "5 book ideas you can create with AI today"
- Before/after cover designs
- Customer testimonials (when you get them)

**Hashtags:** #aiwriting #selfpublish #indieauthor #writingcommunity #bookstagram #amazonkdp #passiveincome

---

### 3. Reddit (HIGH VALUE - Your $50 goes here)

**Subreddits to Target:**

| Subreddit | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| r/selfpublish | Help authors, mention tool naturally when relevant |
| r/writingtools | Direct tool sharing OK here |
| r/amazonkdp | Huge audience of publishers |
| r/childrensbookillustration | Perfect for picture book feature |
| r/SideProject | Share your journey building it |
| r/artificial | AI tool showcase |
| r/EntrepreneurRideAlong | Document your launch |
| r/PassiveIncome | "I built a tool to create books for KDP" |

**Reddit Rules:**
- **DO NOT spam links.** You'll get banned.
- Spend first week commenting helpfully, building karma
- Share genuinely useful posts (not just ads)
- When you do post about the tool, be honest: "I built this"
- Engage in comments for hours after posting

**$50 Spend:** Reddit Ads targeting r/selfpublish, r/amazonkdp
- $25 on a promoted post in writing subreddits
- $25 on retargeting/testing different copy

**Post Templates:**

*For r/SideProject:*
> "I built an AI that writes and illustrates complete books - here's what I learned"
> [Share genuine insights about building it, link at bottom]

*For r/selfpublish:*
> "Created a tool to help with the hardest part of self-publishing - actually finishing the book"
> [Focus on the problem you solve]

---

### 4. X (Twitter)

**Strategy:** Build in public + engage with writing/AI communities

**Content Mix:**
- Thread: "How I built an AI book generator (and what I learned)"
- Daily: Share interesting AI-generated book excerpts
- Engage with: @aiaboratory, indie authors, KDP sellers
- Reply to viral tweets about AI/writing with valuable insights

**Growth Hack:** Find viral tweets about AI or self-publishing, reply with genuine value + subtle mention

---

### 5. Facebook

**Strategy:** Groups > Page

**Groups to Join:**
- Self-Publishing groups
- Amazon KDP groups
- Children's book author groups
- AI Tools groups
- Side hustle/passive income groups

**Approach:**
- Answer questions helpfully for 1-2 weeks
- Then share your tool as a solution to common problems
- Facebook Groups are goldmines for direct sales
